Why I created AAU?

It had been a long time since I asked myself: How the hell professional studios render the scenes? Of course it's all about layers. The more splitted the objects, the more control you will have. Even knowing how to render different objects in layers with Blender, It was very hard to do it and get a decent composition later. What I learned is that to make it work properly, we must render almost each object on the scene in different layers. 

Well, it is not true. We can tweak some stuff, to get something similar to that professional renders, so I decided to create TLR.

How to use it?

1. Press "Select source path" button and select your add-on's path. 
2. A Info section appears, with the add-on name, the selected source path and the target zip file.
3. You can change the target file, by default it will create the zip in the same folder where Source path folder is in.
4. Press "Update selected addon" button to start the process.
5. In "Recent addons" list a new item is created with all the info. Just select the add-on you want, and press "Update addon" button to zip and reinstall it again.
6. "Recent addons" will show up after closing and opening Blender again, so you can start the process again without selecting source path again, with just 1 click.

Thats all!

How to install this addon:

- Download the zip file.
- Open Blender and go to Edit - Preferences
- Go to Get Extensions Tab.
- Click the arrow next to "Repositories", press "Install from disk" button, and search for the downloaded zip file.
- Select it and press Install

Enjoy it!!!
